        <p>Harish Kalyan (born 29 June 1990) is an Indian actor who has predominantly appeared in Tamil language films and also appeared in a few Telugu language films.[1] He made his acting debut in Sindhu Samaveli (2010) opposite debutante Amala Paul, before being noticed for his performances in Poriyaalan (2014), Vil Ambu (2016) and Pyaar Prema Kaadhal (2018).</p>
    
   <p>Harish Kalyan made his debut in Samy's controversial Sindhu Samaveli (2010), portraying the role of Anbu, whose wife has an illicit relationship with her father-in-law.[5][6] Upon release, the film met with contrasting reviews, whilst some critics refused to give the film a rating, declaring their disgust at the film's plot.[7][8] Critics described his next role in the Thaman-musical Aridhu Aridhu (2010) as "okay", but the film also failed to take a strong opening at the box office.[9] Harish then went on to work in S. A. Chandrasekhar's Sattapadi Kutram (2011), which featured Sathyaraj, Vikranth and Bhanu in other roles.[10] The film showcased the changes our legal system demands, with Harish playing a spoilt brat who eventually turns over a new leaf in the film. The film opened to poor reviews and did poorly at the box office. He was next seen alongside Karunas, Shweta Basu Prasad and Sanjana Singh in the 2013 comedy film Chandhamama, before playing a supporting role in the Telugu film, Jai Sriram (2013).[11][12] During the period, he also worked on a bilingual film titled Guest opposite Poonam Kaur, but the film did not have a theatrical release.</p>
